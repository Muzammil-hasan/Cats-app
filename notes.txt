Things i want to optimize/change if more time is given :-
1. I'm using two separates form for edits and create, I will use one according to state. 
(note a big change but will improve performance)
2. Make this website responsive.
3. Better SEO with NextJs, since react-spectrum can not work with NextJs.
4. Showing loading state while CRUD operations.
5. Cat images upload functionality with names and other details.
6. fetching and updating data using RestAPI instead of localStorage.
